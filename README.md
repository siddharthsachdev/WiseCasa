**Home Prediction Bangalore Site** - Your Gateway to Tomorrow's Property Landscape

## Objective

Objective: This project series guides the development of a real estate price prediction website in Bangalore, India, using machine learning. Key goals include data preparation, building a scikit-learn-based linear regression model, handling outliers, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation. It culminates in the creation of a Python Flask server and a user-friendly website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) allowing users to input property details and receive predicted house prices. The project provides a comprehensive hands-on experience in data science, machine learning, web development, and model deployment for those interested in building such applications.
